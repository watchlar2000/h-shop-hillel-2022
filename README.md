# H-Shop
Hillel Project 2022

What you are about to look through is my first serious pet project called H-Shop. It is an e-commerce app. Feel free to play aroung with this app. Any feedback would be higly appreciated. 

## Getting started

First clone the ripo to your local machine. Then install all the dependendecies for both frontend and backend:
```
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
cd ./backend
npm start
```

For now the dev mode is only working. To launch the app go back to the root folder and write down the following:
```
npm run dev
```


All the materials used in this project are for training purposes only.
